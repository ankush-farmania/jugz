Jolly by nature,
Ankush’s love,
Gorgeous looks,
Radiant attractive,
Intelligent enough,
Tremendously talented,
Inspiring and motivating.

At times you are rude,
But does not matter because you are cute,
You don’t look good when mute.

Your smile brightens your face,
Your eyes glitter whole day,
Your face lightens up my day.

You are my world,
You are my priority,
You mean love to me,
You mean life to me…

I LOVE YOU JAGRITI…

<p><FONT STYLE="font-family:Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Jagriti you are the best. I want to be the one you choose when everyone else wants you. I am ready to wait for you. And I am always happy with you. It felt like a dream when we started talking and started to feel for you. My dream is to be your love.  I swear out of this world no one could love you like I do. I want to kiss your forehead while you are asleep. I want to kiss your lips when you wake up. And want to love you 24x7. I want to be your home and adventure at same time. Your look always captures my attention. Looking into your eyes with that cute smile on your face made me start feeling for you and whenever I think of that moment my love for you increases. You don’t need to worry about me cheating on you… I might eat something that was yours but that’s about it. I want to make you realise how beautiful you are so that you start loving yourself even more. I am healthy, peacefully and sanely in love with you. I would always understand your mood and respect you dear. I love loving you and nothing feels better than it. You are the best and the prefect one. You are beautiful as sunset, pretty as rainbow and hot as fire. I just want you close where you can stay forever. I want to date but wont control you ever. Be with me forever. Even we fight sometimes, but still I want you always. I miss you and I need you. Here is the thing. You will never know how happy you make me by just simply existing. And when you smile, oh god it feels like I am in heaven. You know what you are super and I’m really proud of you. I have a big hug waiting for you anytime you need one. You are the person who can delete my whole depression. I want to be your paracetamol when you get sick. Jugz thank you for being there for me whenever I feel sad and needed you. I can’t live without you and don’t want to try. I would do anything to have you in my arms right now. I don’t want a happy ending because anything with you can’t come to an end. The best thing about life is that, I have you in it. I want to hug you tightly. I want to love you the way you deserve to be loved. Your lips on mine, my heart blossoms to shine. I miss you. I want you to be the lucky one to have best friend, boy friend and true love in one person that’s me. I want to be where you are. Even in bad days I’ll still be happy with you. If this life is of 4 days then trust me with you its enough. It always feels nice hearing your voice. And if you I’m addicted then yes, I’m addicted and drugs are: your smile, your eyes and your madness and just you. I want to give you love, respect and understand you. I’ve never love anyone like I love you. I ‘m sorry if I ever hurt you. Call me pooh, because all I want is you, honey. I want to call you for nothing, texts you all time, wants to see you, get jealous and love you. You make me laugh at things that aren’t funny. You make me smile without actually being there. You make my stomach flip by text. You make my heart drop by just saying hi. I admit it, I love you. To my favourite person I used to , does and will eternally love you. I LOVE YOU <3. I love you and want to have you with me forever.</FONT></p>
